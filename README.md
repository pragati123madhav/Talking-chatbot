# Talking-chatbot
Chatbots are conversational tools that perform routine tasks efficiently. 
People like them because they help them get through those tasks quickly so they can focus their attention on high-level, strategic, and engaging activities that require human capabilities that cannot be replicated by machines.

So in this Chatbot project, we are going to make an AI-based contextual chatbot that will maintain the context or in which sense or proportion the user is asking a query. 
Further using deep learning techniques in Python, we will construct a Sequential model for our training sets of data. The intents, patterns, and responses will all be used to train the chatbot. 
The userâ€™s query will be mapped to the intents class using neural networks, which will maintain context and then return a random response.
